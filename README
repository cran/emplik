This package is based on R codes el.cen.EM, el.tr.test
EMPLIKH1, EMPLIKH2, EMPLIKDISC and EL.CEN.TEST
written by Mai Zhou. The code el.test is based on
S code ELM by Owen.  The R code and documentation 
for el.test() have been edited by Mai Zhou, based 
on that of Owen.

Only el.test() can handle vector means as Ho (several
parameters), but data must be uncensored. 
All other code can take right censored data (and may be
more) but can only handle one parameter in Ho.

Everything is written in R, so porting to Splus should be
easy. I may put out another version that more some of the
loop to C function. (is there such need? this will also
make the porting harder)
