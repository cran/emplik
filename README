This package is based on R codes el.cen.EM, el.tr.test
EMPLIKH1, EMPLIKH2, EMPLIKDISC and EL.CEN.TEST
written by Mai Zhou. The code el.test is based on
S code ELM by Owen.  The R code and documentation 
for el.test() have been edited by Mai Zhou, based 
on that of Owen.

Only el.test() can handle vector means as Ho (several
parameters), but data must be uncensored. 
All other codes can only handle one parameter in Ho,
but can take censored/truncated data.
 
The name convention: el.xxx    is for the parameter mean.
                     emplikxxx is for the parameter of hazard.

Everything is written in R, so porting to Splus should be
easy. I may put out another version that move some of the
loops to C function. (is there such need? this will also
make the porting harder)
