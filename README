This package is based on R codes el.cen.EM, el.cen.EM2,
el.trun.test emplikH1, emplikH2, EmpLIKDISC.test() and 
EL.CEN.TEST written by Mai Zhou. 
The code el.test is based on S code ELM by Art Owen. 

el.test() can handle vector means as Ho (several
mean parameters), but data must be uncensored. 
When dealing with censored data use el.cen.EM2() to handle 
vector means.

All other codes in this package can only handle one parameter in Ho.
but that parameter can be mean/hazard/quantile, and can also take 
censored/truncated data.
 
The name convention: el.xxx    is for the parameter of mean.
                     emplikxxx is for the parameter of hazard.

Everything is written in R, so porting to Splus should be
easy. I may put out another version that move some of the
loops to C function. (is there such need? this will also
make the porting harder)
