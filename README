This package is based on R codes 
EMPLIKH1, EMPLIKH2, EMPLIKDISC and EL.CEN.TEST
written by Mai Zhou. The code el.test is based on
S code ELM by Owen.  The R code and documentation 
for el.test() have been edited by Mai Zhou, based 
on that of Owen.

Only el.test() can handle vector means as Ho (several
parameters), but data must be uncensored. 
All other codes can take right censored data but
can only handle one parameter in Ho.
